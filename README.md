# Autodegen

![Autodegen Project](img/autodegen-project.png)

This project is my practice ground to apply the concepts I've learned from the Udemy course [Advanced CSS and Sass](https://www.udemy.com/course/advanced-css-and-sass) by Jonas Schmedtmann.

## Project Overview

For this project, I chose to replicate a design I found on Behance: [AI Autodegen WEB3 UX/UI DESIGN](https://www.behance.net/gallery/199846839/AI-Autodegen-WEB3-UXUI-DESIGN). The design includes a comprehensive web page with the following five sections in its navigation:

1. AI
2. News
3. Terminal
4. About
5. Contacts

## Learning Objective

The primary objective of this project is to reinforce my skills by applying what I learned in the course. The Advanced CSS and Sass course includes three main projects, each focusing on different aspects of CSS and Sass. If you're familiar with the course, you'll know each project is unique in its approach. For now, I will build the Autodegen website following the principles from the first project in the course, which does not use Grid or Flexbox.

## Project Structure

### Sections

- **AI**: This section will showcase AI-related content and features.
- **News**: This section will include the latest news and updates.
- **Terminal**: This section will provide a terminal interface or terminal-related information.
- **About**: This section will give an overview of the website or project.
- **Contacts**: This section will have contact information and a contact form.

### Technology and Tools

- **HTML5**
- **CSS3**
- **Sass**: Leveraging the power of Sass for better CSS management.
- **No Grid or Flexbox**: For this iteration, I'm focusing on traditional layout techniques as per the first project in the course.

## How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository:
2. Navigate to the project directory:
3. Open `index.html` in your preferred web browser to view the site.

## Future Enhancements

In the future, I plan to iterate on this project by incorporating Grid and Flexbox techniques learned in subsequent sections of the course. This will help me to compare and understand the differences and benefits of each approach.
