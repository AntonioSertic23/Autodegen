# Autodegen

![Autodegen Project](img/autodegen-project.png)

This project is my practice ground to apply the concepts I've learned from the Udemy course [Advanced CSS and Sass](https://www.udemy.com/course/advanced-css-and-sass) by Jonas Schmedtmann.

## Project Overview

For this project, I chose to replicate a design I found on Behance: [AI Autodegen WEB3 UX/UI DESIGN](https://www.behance.net/gallery/199846839/AI-Autodegen-WEB3-UXUI-DESIGN). The design includes a comprehensive web page with the following five sections in its navigation:

1. AI
2. News
3. Terminal
4. About
5. Contacts

## Learning Objective

The primary objective of this project is to reinforce my skills by applying what I learned in the course. The Advanced CSS and Sass course includes three main projects, each focusing on different aspects of CSS and Sass. If you're familiar with the course, you'll know each project is unique in its approach.

In this branch, I will build the Autodegen website using the float layout technique. This approach aligns with the principles from the first project in the course, which does not use Grid or Flexbox. By using float layout, I aim to gain a deeper understanding of this traditional method and its application in web design.

## Project Structure

### Sections

- **AI**: This section will showcase AI-related content and features. 游릭 _(Implemented)_
- **News**: This section will include the latest news and updates. 游리 _(Coming Soon)_
- **Terminal**: This section will provide a terminal interface or terminal-related information. 游리 _(Coming Soon)_
- **About**: This section will give an overview of the website or project. 游리 _(Coming Soon)_
- **Contacts**: This section will have contact information and a contact form. 游리 _(Coming Soon)_

### Technology and Tools

- **HTML5**
- **CSS3**
- **Sass**: Leveraging the power of Sass for better CSS management.
- **No Grid or Flexbox**: For this iteration, I'm focusing on traditional layout techniques as per the first project in the course.

## How to Run the Project

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AntonioSertic23/Autodegen.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

   ```bash
    cd Autodegen
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Compile Sass to CSS:**

   - **Option 1**: Use npm to compile the Sass files into CSS:

   ```bash
   npm run compile:sass
   ```

   - **Option 2**: Use npm to watch Sass files for changes and automatically compile:

   ```bash
   npm run watch:sass
   ```

5. **Open the project in a web browser:**

   - **Option 1**: Open `index.html` in your preferred web browser.
   - **Option 2**: Use a live server tool for easier development and automatic reloading (e.g., Live Server in VSCode).

## Future Enhancements

This branch focuses on implementing the project using the Float Layout technique. For a comprehensive understanding of different layout methods, you can explore other branches in this repository:

- **flexbox-layout**: See how the same project is built using Flexbox techniques.
- **grid-layout**: Explore the project implemented with CSS Grid.

By comparing these branches, you can understand the differences, advantages, and limitations of each approach.
